## Databases, tables, rows, and columns

### Terminology

* _schema_: a logical storage area for data collected into tables
* _tablespaces_: a physical storage area on disk for data
* _table_: a named collection of records, all with the same structure defined
  by columns.
* _row_: a record in a table that represents all the data that takes to
  describe the entity stored in the table.
* _column_: a field in a table that all records will have. Columns have a name
  and a type.
* _primary key_: a unique id that identifies a single row in a table. This
  will usually be an auto-incrementing number called `id`, although that is
  not a requirement of the database.
* _SQL_: Structured Query Language. A _declarative_ programming language for
  defining databases and extracting and manipulating information from them.
